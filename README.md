A site that reviews the best lecturer in the iSchool Greg Hay!

1. I talked to a few of my classmates and students in other 343 classes about how they solved certain problems. Then worked on implementing my own solutions. 

2.Nope

3.I probably spent like 20 hours on this assignment.

4.Well the only problem I encountered was that I found out Greg knew about my review website. So instead of doing reviews I changed it so people could list their favorite memories instead.
